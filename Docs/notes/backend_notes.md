## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
## Relational queries in SQL 

Basically a single table is good when data is one-to-one. When you have thousands of rows and columns of data, where the data is one-to-many, multiple tables are better to reduce duplicate data.



`cross join sql `
- SELECT * FROM student_grades, students;
