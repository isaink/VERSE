## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
## Relational queries in SQL 

Basically a single table is good when data is one-to-one. When you have thousands of rows and columns of data, where the data is one-to-many, multiple tables are better to reduce duplicate data.



`cross join sql `
- SELECT * FROM student_grades, students;

## security vulnerability?
$ yarn add set-value@2.0.1 ....

Try deleting yarn.lock file and install the dependencies again.

'yarn install --check-files'

yarn.lock is auto-generated on yarn install which should update set-value to version 2.0.1

hope this helps, Happy coding!!!
